INTRODUCTION TO-OBJECTS AND CLASSES,What is a Class? ,A logical template to create objects that share common properties and methods,Blueprint for creating objects ,There are three types of classes - Application (has a main method; runs the program); Template Class (can’t run; no main method); Test Class (used to test different template classes),What is an Object? ,An instance of a Java class; a copy of a specific class,An object is a member of the java class,An object of a class must be created before an object is a member of the java class,What is an Instance Variable? ,A variable that is specific to a certain object and define that object ,Instance Variables are always kept at the Private access level,Also known as Fields; Attributes; Properties; Characteristics ,What is an Access Modifier? ,Keywords that can be used to control the visibility of fields; methods; and constructors in a class,There are three types of modifiers we mainly user: Public; Private and Protected ,Public is accessible everywhere; Private is only accessible in its own class; Protected can only be accessed in its own class; a subclass of its own class and its own package  ,20,110,35,images/code/class.PNG,images/code/object--instance.PNG,images/code/fields.PNG,images/code/access modifier.PNG,360,5,300,300,340,5,150,300,200,5,200,300,200,5,120,275
METHOD-DECLARATION,What is a Method? ,It follows the idea of “dividing and conquering”,A block of code that; when called; performs specific actions mentioned in it,It can receive and send values ,What is an Argument? ,The actual values that are passed to variables defined in the method header when the method is called from another method,Whenever any particular method is called during the execution of the program; there are some values that are passed to call that particular method.,The constructor (term next next lesson) arguments needs to correspond with the constructor parameter ,What is a Parameter? ,The variables that are listed as part of a method brackets (declaration) ,It is the variable that is used while the function is called,The constructor has a parameter for each field,Method Header ,To declare a method; one line called the method header is needed to define the method ,Method name follows the return type in the method declaration and Empty parentheses after the method name indicate that the method does not require additional information to perform its task or parameters in parentheses to pass any other values ,For example: public void displayName(){},60,120,40,images/code/method.PNG,images/code/argument.PNG,images/code/parameters.PNG,images/code/methodHeader.jpg,360,5,200,275,300,10,360,300,300,5,100,300,340,5,20,300
DECLARING CLASS-AND-INSTANTIATING-AN OBJECT,What is an Instance?,An instance is specific to a class (an Object),Instances of a class have the same set of attributes,Each instance may be different because of the value inside each attribute,How to Return a Value from a Method,First: add Return type - which specifies data type - of value in method declaration (use keyword void to indicate that a method will NOT return a value) ,Second: assign the returned value to a variable (to store it) ,This is especially useful if the method is used to process or calculate something; and another method requires the end value,How to Call A Method From Another Class,Typically; you cannot call a method that belongs to another class until you create an object of that class,To create an instance of a class; the Keyword - new - can be used ,For example: GradeBook myGradeBook = new GradeBook();  ,Static Methods ,A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class,"It is special because it can be called without first creating an object of the class in which the method is declared",The main method is an example of a static method ,50,140,35,images/code/object--instance.PNG,images/code/return.PNG,images/code/callMethod.PNG,images/code/staticMethod.PNG,340,5,100,300,100,10,200,300,50,5,110,275,360,5,100,275
PRIMITIVE VS REFERENCE-DATA TYPES-&-FLOATING POINT NUMBERS,What is a Primitive Data Type?,Primitive data types are the most basic data types available within the Java language,Examples include: boolean; int; double; long; short; char,Types are divided into primitive types and reference types,What is a Reference Data Type?,Reference types are those which contain reference/address of dynamically created objects,Examples include: String; Scanner; Arrays; any class that start with a Capital letter ,Types are divided into primitive types and reference types,What is a Floating-Point Number?,A number with a decimal point such as 7.33; 0.0975,This number can be seen in float and double data types ,float represents single-precision floating-point numbers up to seven significant digits while double represents double-precision floating-point numbers that require twice as much memory as float and provide 15 significant digits,Format Specifiers ,When printing out a floating-point number or any variable; we can use System.out.printf to format the output,A common format specifier is %.2f (%f is used to output values of double and float while .2 rounds to 2 decimal places),Example: System.out.printf(“The circle has a radius of %.2f”; 5.6898989898);  ,20,120,30,images/code/primitive.PNG,images/code/reference.PNG,images/code/floating--point.PNG,images/code/format.PNG,250,5,80,260,250,10,150,275,160,5,300,275,360,5,80,275
HOW TO-CREATE A-TEMPLATE CLASS,What are Constructors? ,A special method that is used to initialize objects,Name of the constructor method must be exactly the same as the name of the class ,Used to create an instance (term in Lesson 3) of a class ,What are Getters?,Returns the value of the variable name,Also referred to as Get Methods and Accessors ,Getters should always be kept at the Public access level,What are Setters? ,Takes a parameter and assigns it to the name (instance/field) variable,Also referred to as Set Methods and Mutators ,Setters should always be kept at the Public access level,What is a toString Method?,Returns the String representation of an Object ,It is a built-in Java Method ,toString is an optional method; unlike getters and setters (which play an important role in updating the value of a variable) and constructors,45,120,40,images/code/constructor.PNG,images/code/getters.PNG,images/code/setters.PNG,images/code/toString.jpg,290,5,150,270,320,10,150,275,320,5,100,300,200,5,30,300
